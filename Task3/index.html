                        <h4>Childhood Cancer</h4>
                        <p>
                            Childhood cancer is a serious health issue that affects thousands of children around the world every year.<br>
                            Unlike adult cancers, childhood cancers are often not linked to lifestyle or environmental factors.<br>
                            Instead, they typically develop due to changes in the child's genes or cells as they grow.<br>
                            The most common types of childhood cancer include leukemia (cancer of the blood), brain tumors, and lymphomas.<br>
                            These diseases can grow quickly, but many of them are highly treatable if diagnosed early and managed with the right medical care.<br>
                            Treatment for childhood cancer often involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and sometimes surgery.<br>
                            In many cases, children require long hospital stays and ongoing follow-up care.<br>
                            While treatment can be challenging, advances in medicine have significantly improved survival rates.<br>
                            Supporting children with cancer goes beyond medical treatment. Emotional, psychological,<br>
                            and social support for both the children and their families is essential.<br>
                            Hospitals like 57357 in Egypt are dedicated to providing this full circle of care for free,<br>
                            giving hope to thousands of families.<br>
                            Raising awareness, funding research, and ensuring access to high-quality care are key steps<br>
                            toward beating childhood cancer and giving every child the chance to grow up healthy and strong.
